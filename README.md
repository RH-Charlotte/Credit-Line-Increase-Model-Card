The measurement scale for the repayment status is: -1 = pay duly; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; ...; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above |
| **BILL_AMT1 - BILL_AMT6** | inputs | float | amount of bill statement; BILL_AMNT1 = amount of bill statement in September, 2005; BILL_AMT2 = amount of bill statement in August, 2005; ...; BILL_AMT6 = amount of bill statement in April, 2005 |
| **PAY_AMT1 - PAY_AMT6** | inputs | float | amount of previous payment; PAY_AMT1 = amount paid in September, 2005; PAY_AMT2 = amount paid in August, 2005; ...; PAY_AMT6 = amount paid in April, 2005 |
| **DELINQ_NEXT**| target | int | whether a customer's next payment is delinquent (late), 1 = late; 0 = on-time |

### Ethical Considerations
**Describe potential negative impacts of using your model**:
- **Math or software problems**:
    * Prone to overfitting (random forest can greatly reduce overfitting).
    * Easy to igonre the correlation of attributes in the data set.
    * When calculating information, the result is biased towards features with more numerical values.
    * In the calculation of the decision tree, there will be overfitting in some noisy classification and regression problems. For data with different levels of attributes, attributes with more levels will have a greater impact on the random forest, so the attribute weights generated by the random forest on this kind of data are unreliable.

- **Real-world risks: who, what, when or how**?
    * Those who are applying the model to business decision may be affected by biased opinions. Therefore, rules and ethic code are needed along with this model.

**Describe potential uncertainties relating to the impacts of using your mode**:
- **Math or software problems**: Prediction is not accurate and is vulnerable to uncertain changes in the future. At the same time, the data this model used may not be a true reflection of reality, so applying this model may not lead to a precise result.
- **Real-world risks: who, what, when or how**?
It is possible to have situation like jeopardize a group of peopleâ€™s interests when using a model with uncertainties. In addition, biased opinion will lead to unneutral decision making.

 **Describe any unexpected or results**:
Some demographic variables have correlation with the analysis
